URL Title Preview
=================

This script extends the popup menu for HTTP URLs to display the title of a HTML page. It therefore introduces a short delay before the popup actually appears, as the page is downloaded.

If the *htmlentities* script is present, it will be used to parse HTML entities in the title.

It was tested with KVIrc version 4.9.2 'Aria'.

Installation
------------

Simply run the script.

To do this, from the KVIrc menu, select *Scripting* â†’ *Execute Script* (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` up to twice), then select `urltitle.kvs` in the dialog.

Alternatively, enter `/parse path/to/urltitle.kvs`.
