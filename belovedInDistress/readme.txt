This is a hangman game i created.

After running the script, it should echo that it installed.  there is no uninstaller at this time, so take note of all the files it creates in the script to remove it.

you need the dictionary installed for this script to work.  The Dictionary File is called wordsEn.txt and must be installed in /echo $file.localdir(ScriptFiles/wordsEn.txt)

then a user types BID in the room they want to play in, and then say random.  then its game on.

if the person running the script wants to play or give a command like in the room, they must type "/bid *" with * being the command, same as in the room.
