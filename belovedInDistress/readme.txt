This is a hangman game.

After running the script, it should echo that it installed.  there is no uninstaller at this time, so take note of all the files it creates in the script to remove it.  simply disabling the on events should be enough to stop unwanted behavoir if removal is neccessary.

you need the dictionary installed for this script to work.  The Dictionary File is called wordsEn.txt and must be installed in "/echo $file.localdir(ScriptFiles/wordsEn.txt)" type this in kvirc to see where.

then a user types BID in the room they want to play in, and then say random.  then its game on.  they just type single letters, such as a, b, c.  etc.  until the word is solved. its challenging though.

if the person running the script wants to play or give a command like in the room, they must type "/bid bid" or "/bid a" etc, being the command, same as in the room.
